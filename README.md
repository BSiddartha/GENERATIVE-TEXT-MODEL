# DESCRIPTION:
The LSTM-based Text Generator is a deep learning model designed to predict and generate text sequences based on a given input. It utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is highly effective in capturing long-term dependencies in text.
In this project, a text corpus is tokenized and converted into sequences, which are then used to train an LSTM model. The model learns patterns from the provided dataset and generates coherent sentences based on a given seed text.
Key Features:
Uses TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning implementation.
Tokenization and sequence padding ensure the input format is optimized for training.
Embedding layers help the model learn meaningful word representations.
LSTM layers capture long-term dependencies in text sequences.
Dropout layers prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.
Sequential model structure ensures efficient training and prediction.
Application Areas:
Automated content generation
Chatbots and virtual assistants
Creative writing tools
Text completion systems
